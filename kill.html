				Your roommate is dead! You feel terrible and super guilty, but these awful feelings fuel your art for years to come. Your journal grows to be filled with these ideas and the event becomes a huge theme in your art, to which you can devote tons of time now that you can work uninterrupted. You sell many of these pieces and make lots of money. Congrats!
